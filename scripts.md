Unity uses C# coding to control objects and other behaviors

# Below is an example script
```
using UnityEngine;

public class HelloWorld : MonoBehaviour
{
  void Start()
  {
    Debug.Log("Hello, World!");
  }
}
```

In this script, when the game starts the tester will see "Hellow, World!" in the console. This sort of coding is helpful especially in debugging.
