GameObjects are used as the basic building blocks within a Unity Scene.

# Here are some common built in GameObjects:
- Cube - Simple 3D object
- Sphere - Good for physic tests
- UI Text - Show text on the screen
- Empty Object - Used for grouping things together

# Tips
- Use Reset Transform to fix something if weirdly positioned or rotated
- put related objects inside empty parent objects
- Use the inspector to edit
